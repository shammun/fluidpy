# Explainer patterns — what worked, what failed, what to promote

Read by the curator, designer, viz-builders and viz-reviewer before any explainer work. Appended by the knowledge-keeper.

## Patterns that worked
| Pattern | Where proven | Why it works |
|---|---|---|
| Walkthrough step that sets the parameters itself, then shows one inline slider ("Drag U and watch…") | `templates/viz_example.html` step 3 | the reader sees the change before being asked to act |
| Live equation card in a walkthrough step (`eq:` + `live:`) | `templates/viz_example.html` step 4 | symbols become numbers the reader controls |
| Tracer particles + streamlines + colour field on one stage | `templates/viz_example.html` | motion shows what a static streamline plot hides |
| Draggable probe showing the local velocity vector | `templates/viz_example.html` | direct manipulation of "the field at a point" |

## Failures and fixes
| Problem | Where | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| App shell not 100 % high → panels clipped on phones but the audit saw no overflow | engine, before chapter 1 | `#app` height 100 %; audit fails `app-does-not-fill-window` |
| A walkthrough step with text + controls + readouts + equation overflowed on 360×640 | example step 5 | ≤ 2 extras per step |
| Explore intro + callouts pushed the controls off a phone screen | example | callouts optional by default; intro hidden at density 3 on phones |

## Promotion candidates (helpers duplicated across explainers)
| Helper | Found in | Proposed library name |
|---|---|---|

## Ideas for later chapters
(seeded from `book.yaml → viz_seeds`; the curator decides)

## Reference explainers (the depth to match)
See skill `interactive-viz` §4–§5: Shammunul's MIT-mathlet re-implementations (angular frequency explorer; amplitude and
phase, second order II) and the fast.ai labs (FID formula lab, forward noising lab, pixels as parameters, random copy,
overfitting curves, stride & padding playground, 3-D U-Net and ResNet). Passing in-repo templates that use every engine
feature: `templates/viz_example.html`, `templates/viz_example_field.html`, `templates/viz_example_3d.html`.
