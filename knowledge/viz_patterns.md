# Explainer patterns — what worked, what failed, what to promote

Read by the curator, designer, viz-builders and viz-reviewer before any explainer work. Appended by the knowledge-keeper.

## Patterns that worked
| Pattern | Where proven | Why it works |
|---|---|---|
| Walkthrough step that sets the parameters itself, then shows one inline slider ("Drag U and watch…") | `templates/viz_example.html` step 3 | the reader sees the change before being asked to act |
| Live equation card in a walkthrough step (`eq:` + `live:`) | `templates/viz_example.html` step 4 | symbols become numbers the reader controls |
| Tracer particles + streamlines + colour field on one stage | `templates/viz_example.html` | motion shows what a static streamline plot hides |
| Draggable probe showing the local velocity vector | `templates/viz_example.html` | direct manipulation of "the field at a point" |
| Explain tab in numbered sections: what the colours are → each quantity from the controls (boxed results) → at the current time → "Reading the current setting" | `templates/viz_example.html` (after `forced_damped_vibrations.html`) | every number on screen is accounted for, then interpreted for the regime the reader chose |
| Derivation step that moves the picture (`set`) and shows the line with the reader's numbers (`live`) | `templates/viz_example.html` derivations `energy` step 4, `omegad` step 2 | the symbols in the derivation become the numbers and curves on screen |
| Walkthrough step quoting one derivation step with an "All steps →" button | `templates/viz_example.html` tour step 4 | the story stays short while the full derivation is one click away |

## Failures and fixes
| Problem | Where | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| App shell not 100 % high → panels clipped on phones but the audit saw no overflow | engine, before chapter 1 | `#app` height 100 %; audit fails `app-does-not-fill-window` |
| A walkthrough step with text + controls + readouts + equation overflowed on 360×640 | example step 5 | ≤ 2 extras per step |
| Explore intro + callouts pushed the controls off a phone screen | example | callouts optional by default; intro hidden at density 3 on phones |
| 7 tabs squeezed the title into a one-letter column on a 768 px tablet (no overflow, but views shrank below 60 px) | example, Explain + Derivation added | header falls back to short labels, then to a tab row of its own |
| Derivation tab on phones left 19 px views for a 3-view stage | example | phones keep one view (`derivation.view`) and hide the preset strip and transport on that tab |
| A derivation line "r = … = …" and a long live line overflowed the side panel in the 1000×700 notebook frame | example `omegad` step 4, `energy` step 4 | one relation per line; definitions move to their own step or into *why* |
| Term bars in a walkthrough step showed "–" | engine | term rows index their own item (bars from several blocks) and stale rows are dropped |

## Promotion candidates (helpers duplicated across explainers)
| Helper | Found in | Proposed library name |
|---|---|---|

## Ideas for later chapters
(seeded from `book.yaml → viz_seeds`; the curator decides)

## Reference explainers (the depth to match)
See skill `interactive-viz` §4–§5: Shammunul's preferred MIT-mathlet re-implementations (forced damped vibrations — the
explanation panel; amplitude and phase, second order II — a numbered live derivation; angular frequency explorer —
linked views and modes) and the fast.ai labs (FID formula lab, forward noising lab, pixels as parameters, random copy,
overfitting curves, stride & padding playground, 3-D U-Net and ResNet). Passing in-repo templates that use every engine
feature: `templates/viz_example.html`, `templates/viz_example_field.html`, `templates/viz_example_3d.html`.
